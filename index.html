		<p>
			Hello, my name is Amanda Blewett. The purpose of this website is to demonstrate my ability to create a website and share my talents.
			I am a current senior at the University of Oklahoma, majoring in Marketing and Management Information Systems.
			My hope is to one day become a senior data analyst at a leading company, and I am willing to start out small.
			I am currently a Data Analyst Intern here on campus and help with visualizing student data for University College and other departments to help Deans 
			and Advisors make decisions for the future of their programs and the benefit of the students. I hope you enjoy my website and I can't wait to see where life takes me!
		</p>
